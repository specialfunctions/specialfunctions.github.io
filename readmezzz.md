[Web Math Read Me]( index.html#readme.md )

Wikipedia sayeth:

> Special functions are particular mathematical functions which have more or less established names and notations due to their importance in mathematical analysis, functional analysis, physics, or other applications.

> There is no general formal definition, but the list of mathematical functions contains functions which are commonly accepted as special.

Our mission is to put this stuff in your face so fast, and with so little effort and so stupidly that you actually understand it.

### Challenge #1

Is it possible to add a link to a single JavaScript file to sample.html so that it loads and displays in a timely fashion rather than crashing?

### Solution to Challenge 1

* Challenge mostly accomplished
* Challenge #2: is it possible with only a single set of script tags?

### Challenge #2

Is it possible to comply with Challenge #1 using only a single set of <script> tags?

### Solution to Challenge #2

* [sample-266-multiple-iframes-r1.html]( https://webmath.github.io/sandbox/multiple-iframes/sample-266-multiple-iframes-r1.html ) ~ 266 iframes and texts
