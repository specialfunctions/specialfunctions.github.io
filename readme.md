Wikipedia sayeth:

> Special functions are particular mathematical functions which have more or less established names and notations due to their importance in mathematical analysis, functional analysis, physics, or other applications.

> There is no general formal definition, but the list of mathematical functions contains functions which are commonly accepted as special.

Our mission is to put this stuff in your face so fast, and with so little effort and so stupidly that you actually understand it.

## Guidelines for this organization

* Nothing breakable: scripts linking to external libraries should always use a numbered version

* Every new HTML page should have a minimal readme.md file with at least a link to the live version
